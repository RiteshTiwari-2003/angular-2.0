-> Angular notes:-
    introductiuon of angular:-
Angular is typescript based open source famework for building dynamic , modern web application ,
developed and maintained by google , anguler provide a comprehensive platform for creating highly responsive and scalable application.

-> key feature of angular:
1. component based architecture :
application are build using reusable , self contained component,making the development process moduler and amintainable 
2. two ways data binding:
synchronizes data between the model(logic) and view(ui) in real time, reducing boilerplate code and inhancing user interaction
3. dependency injection :
pramotes moduler design by providing a buildin dependency injection system to manage service objects 
4. directives : 
extend html with custom tag or attributes, enabling developer to build dynamics interactive ui interface .
5. rxjs(reactive programming):
provide tools for handling asynchronous data streams , making angular application more responsive .
6. routing and navigation :
the build in anguler router enable the creation of single page application with seamless transition between views.
7. ahead of time compilation :
convert html and type script code into optimized javascript code during the build process, improving performance.
8. cross platform support:
anguler can be used for building web , mobile and desktop application.
-- view layer of application 
--> with the help of anguler we can develop single page application , single page application are those application which develop only in one page ,
which is index.html, the data is just updated in the dom without refreshing or reloading whole application .
that is the single page appication 
in traditional application : whenever we go for any of the link , the entire page is reload and all, right now the single page application 
the page is not refreah or reload .
-> developed and maintained by google .

single psge application are those application which developp only in one page , the content is updated  without reloading or refreahing whole page

--> Envoirment setup(installation):-
node js envoirment 
   --> download and install node js 
   node >20
if node installed in system then for angular install angular cli(command line interface):
it provides commands for creating , building , testing and deploying angular application.(ng command) : new generate command
npm i @angular/cli --g
after instaling above package when you want to check ng version type ng --version
and in that folder where you want to put angular project open that folder in cmd and type ng new demo(project_name) and enter .

--> how we run angular application:-
go to your project folder like :- cd demo
ng serve --o
to run angular application every time you should run ng serve 
and --o is a flag to open your application in a default browser if you not putting --o then you should manually open it.
open in default port 4000

why choose angular?
1. powerful framework: 
include all tools required for large scale application .
2. active ecosystem: backed by google ,with frequent update and large community.
3. scalable : well suited for enterprise level projects.
4. typescript integration : enhance code quality with strong typing .

for angular documentation refrence:-
https://angular.dev/overview
for project folder structure reference
https://angular.dev/reference/configs/file-structure

--> how angular application run or boot:-
ng serve whenever i run ng serve then it goes to the angular.json file--> thenit call entry point file--> one is index.html and typescript entry point file is main.ts  
in that index.html there is <app-root></app-root> what is the app-root app-root is selector which is define in App component the App component 
is default component 
so you can find that component in src/app folder in app folder app.component.ts  app.component.html app.component.css file app.component.spec.ts  
app.component.ts (logic) 
   in app.component.ts we find app-root selector 
app.component.html(view)
app.component.css (component css) 
app.component.spec.ts (testing file)

there is two type of entry point file one is index.html and one is main.ts typescript entry point file
-> in new version > 17
it boot the App component and load AppConfig file in the application .
-> below it 
it boot the AppModule and in appmodule it boot the app component 

so in this way in the old approach is module based approach nut right now it changes as configuration based approach.
